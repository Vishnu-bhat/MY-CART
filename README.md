## 💡 Purpose
Moonlit was built as part of the Hult Prize Startup Competition, with the goal of empowering local artisans by giving them a digital storefront to showcase and sell their handcrafted products. Many rural and small-scale artisans lack online visibility—Moonlit bridges this gap with a scalable and user-friendly e-commerce solution tailored to their needs.
